🤖 ChatBot-with-Python
ChatBot with Python is an educational open source project that demonstrates how to build a basic chatbot using Python and a simple artificial intelligence model. It is designed to help beginner programmers understand the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP), conversational logic, and chatbot architecture.

🎯 Project Goals
Introduce users to the core concepts of NLP and AI.

Show how to use a dataset to recognize user intents and generate responses.

Provide a lightweight, local chatbot that runs without external APIs.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity

NumPy for numerical operations

JSON for storing intents and responses
